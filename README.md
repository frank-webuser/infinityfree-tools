# About this

This is a tool used along side with the InfinityFree free hosting. It was still far from perfect but I felt good about sharing this already.

Note I was not affilated with InfinityFree in whatever way.

# How to use

Dependencies:

- PHP 7.2+
- [io-developer/php-whois](https://github.com/io-developer/php-whois/)

The `php-whois` library should already be included.

If you prefer to install on you own, then go to the `functions` folder and run:

```
composer require io-developer/php-whois
```

# Important notice

This tool is buggy as for now ---- sometimes it raises unexpected errors, give out false data, etc. Things are good for the whois part (as it was based on another library.)
